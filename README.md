- **Type-Safe API Client**: Ensures type safety and reduces runtime errors.
- **Caching Strategy**: Improves performance and reduces API calls.
- **Feature Flags**: Allows for selective enabling/disabling of API features.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Modular Architecture**: Structured into independent modules for easy maintenance and scalability.

## API Integration

The core API integration is located in the \`lib\` directory:

- \`desk365-facade.ts\`: Provides a simplified interface to the Desk365 API.
- \`desk365-admin-service.ts\`: Extends the Desk365 facade to include administrative functions.
- \`cache/\`: Contains the caching implementation.

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive testing suite:

- \`tests/unit/\`: Unit tests for individual components and functions.
- \`tests/integration/\`: Integration tests for testing the interaction between different parts of the system.
- \`tests/e2e/\`: End-to-end tests for testing the entire application flow.

To run the tests:

\`\`\`bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
\`\`\`
